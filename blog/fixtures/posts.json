    "body": "Apple cakes are cakes in which apples feature as a main flavour and ingredient. Such cakes incorporate apples in a variety of forms, including diced, pureed, or stewed, and can include common additions like raisins, nuts, and 'sweet' spices such as cinnamon or nutmeg. They are a common and popular dessert worldwide, thanks to millennia of apple cultivation in Asia and Europe, and their widespread introduction and propagation throughout the Americas during the Columbian Exchange and colonisation. As a result, apple desserts, including cakes, have a huge number of variations.\r\n\r\nApples are also used in other cakes to add moisture and sweetness, often as a partial substitute for refined sugar.",

    "body": "Bara brith is a traditional Welsh tea bread flavoured with tea, dried fruits and spices.\r\n\r\nA decrease in its popularity led to supermarket Morrisons removing it from their shelves in 2006, and a year later a survey showed that 36% of teenagers in Wales had never tried it. It has been subsequently championed by celebrity chefs such as Bryn Williams. Several variations on bara brith have been made, including changing it into a chocolate and into ice cream. \r\n\r\nThe bread is made by mixing flour (either white or self-raising), yeast (if not using self-raising flour), butter, mixed dried fruit (such as raisins, currants and sultanas), mixed spices and an egg. Some recipes favour soaking the dried fruit in tea overnight before the baking. This mixture is then proofed to allow fermentation to take place. After an initial period, the air is knocked out of the mixture and it is allowed to proof once more. This period of preparation can take up to two hours, including the resting time for the bread mixture. It is then baked in an oven.Bara brith is traditionally served at tea time, alongside tea. It is normally served in slices with butter spread on one side.",

It is soft, with small or no holes, a compact touch, few cuts, and no skin. Crumbly with a slightly grainy texture, it is formed into large blocks and aged in brine. Its flavor is tangy and salty, ranging from mild to sharp. Feta is used as a table cheese, in salads such as Greek salad, and in pastries, notably the phyllo-based Greek dishes spanakopita \"spinach pie\" and tyropita \"cheese pie\". It is often served with olive oil or olives, and sprinkled with aromatic herbs such as oregano. It can also be served cooked (often grilled), as part of a sandwich, in omelettes, and many other dishes.\r\n\r\nSince 2002, feta has been a protected designation of origin in the European Union. EU legislation and similar legislation in 25 other countrieslimits the name feta to cheeses produced in the traditional way in mainland Greece and Lesbos Prefecture, which are made from sheep's milk, or from a mixture of sheep's and up to 30% of goat's milk from the same area.\r\n\r\nSimilar white, brined cheeses (often called \"white cheese\" in various languages) are made traditionally in the Balkans and around the Black Sea, and more recently elsewhere. Outside the EU, the name feta is often used generically for these cheeses.",

    "body": "Strained yogurt, Greek yogurt, yogurt cheese, sack yogurt, or kerned yogurt is yogurt that has been strained to remove most of its whey, resulting in a thicker consistency than normal unstrained yogurt, while still preserving the distinctive sour taste of yogurt. Like many types, strained yogurt is often made from milk enriched by boiling off some water content, or by adding extra butterfat and powdered milk. In Europe and North America, it is often made from low-fat or fat-free cow's milk. In Iceland, a similar product named skyr is made.\r\n\r\nStrained yogurt is generally marketed in North America as \"Greek yogurt\" and in the UK as \"Greek-style yogurt\", though strained yogurt is also widely eaten in Levantine, Eastern Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, Central Asian and South Asian cuisines, where it is often used in cooking, as it curdles less readily when cooked. It is used in a variety of dishes, cooked or raw, savory or sweet. Straining makes even nonfat varieties thicker, richer, and creamier than unstrained. Since straining removes the whey, more milk is required to make strained yogurt, increasing the production cost. Thickeners such as pectin, locust bean gum, starches or guar gum may also be used to thicken yogurts. In western Europe and the US, strained yogurt has increased in popularity compared to unstrained yogurt. Since the straining process removes some of the lactose, strained yogurt is lower in sugar than unstrained yogurt.\r\n\r\nIt was reported in 2012 that most of the growth in the $4.1 billion American yogurt industry came from the strained yogurt sub-segment, typically marketed as \"Greek yogurt\". In the US, there is no legal or standard definition of Greek yogurt, and yogurt thickened with thickening agents may also be sold as \"Greek yogurt\".",
